## Educational (Yandex)

### Determining the age of customers ([link](https://github.com/RadarYV/Neural-Networks/blob/main/Educational%20(Yandex)/Image.%20Regression/define_age_by%20photo.ipynb))
You have 60000 images with people and their ages. Build a model to predict age by photo. Metric MAE should be less than 8 years.
<br>**Result:** Built and trained a convolutional neural network based on ResNet50 with Pooling layer on a dataset with photos of people.
<br>**Tags**
tensorflow.keras

### Text Classification with BERT ([link](https://github.com/RadarYV/Neural-Networks/blob/main/Educational%20(Yandex)/Image.%20Regression/define_age_by%20photo.ipynb))
You need to train the model to classify comments into positive and negative. A quality of model (F1) should be at least 0.75.
<br>**Result:** Prepared the data (tokens, attention mask, embeddings), made models Logistic Regression and LightGBM for predict comment class on embeddings.
<br>**Tags** BERT, torch, transformers, embeddings, tokens, attention mask



## Educational (DLS MIPT)

### Practice building neural networks using the Pytorch library ([link](https://github.com/RadarYV/Neural-Networks/blob/main/Educational%20(DLS%20MIPT)/Dense_and_convolutional_Nets/%5Bhomework%5D_2022_10_29_dense_and_convolutional_nn.ipynb))
Implement Logistic regression with own hands, solve MNIST using a fully connected neural network and try different activation functions. 

See how different convolutions affect the photo. Solve MNIST using a the LeNet architecture.

<br>**Result:** Solved MNIST dataset with dense NN with different activations and LeNet.
