# Practice building neural networks using the Pytorch library

Solve MNIST dataset with dense NN with different activations and LeNet.

## Task
Implement Logistic regression with own hands, solve MNIST using a fully connected neural network and try different activation functions.

See how different convolutions affect the photo. Solve MNIST using a the LeNet architecture.
